    TextBody: Hello, I was told by the project manager something was wrong with the
      newest build?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}

  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}
    TextBody: The thing won't get past login! "Wrong" isn't even the start of it!
      It's not even making it out of the gate!!!! I put it together, load it on a
      device and get stuck on a loading screen!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}

    TextBody: Not making it past the login? Sounds bad. Can I go to a developer?
      Would they know what's happening?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}
    TextBody: You can try. Just be careful! There's the frontend and backend teams,
      and they don't always play nicely!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}
    TextBody: Or just hate each other, I don't know. Don't get inbetween them if
      you can help it! We keep the backend team in the basement. Or maybe it's a
      dungeon?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Dungeon? Isn't that a bit mean to put them down there?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4d657e87af8da3e46896bca93e4a5512, type: 2}
    TextBody: I think they like it down there honestly. You know how programmers
      are.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Haha yeah! (What?)
