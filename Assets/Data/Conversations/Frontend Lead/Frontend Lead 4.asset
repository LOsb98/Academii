  Dialogues:
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hi, how can I help you?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: I've just been speaking with the backend team and wow your office is
      way nicer what's up wi-
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: I see, I assume they're trying to blame us for something going wrong
      AGAIN?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Well that's what we need to get to the bottom of. They told me there's
      an API issue, but it looks ok on their end.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: And you trust their standards for "Ok"? They could send completely
      incorrectly formatted information, they would still say it was "Ok" and ask
      what the issue was! Honestly!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: I'm not interested in workplace politics. Can you please take a look
      at the error they're receiving?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: I'll get in touch now. Give me one moment please.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hello? :)
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8f3e30385ec7a1e40b2588b0e6f6bb35, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hi.....................I wondered how long it would take to hear from
      you...............
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hahaha yeah!!!!!!! :) Anyway, what's the error message saying exactly?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8f3e30385ec7a1e40b2588b0e6f6bb35, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hmmm.......well the API itself doesn't return any errors............I
      send a request and it works just fine..........build team says they get an
      error after the login form.......
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: That doesn't make any sense though, let me have a look. Oh, it looks
      like an error on our end. Awesome.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Which line..............................? Ah, it's here, when we get
      the user's date of birth. But I'm pulling from the correct field!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Hmmmm.........
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Don't tell me you know what the issue is.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: How are you formatting that date? There are a lot of different standards,
      it's very easy to mix up.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8f3e30385ec7a1e40b2588b0e6f6bb35, type: 2}
    TextBody: Oh, it's formatted DD/MM/Y-
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: What! No it isn't, it's MM/DD/YY!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Oh no.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8f3e30385ec7a1e40b2588b0e6f6bb35, type: 2}
    TextBody: Well that's the way it's done in all the other APIs that return a date.................none
      of those have been causing issues.................
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f499a2d0ec8cc2044904751d4c92555e, type: 2}
    TextBody: Wow! :) That must be it then. I haven't worked with any of those other
      APIs before. A previous developer must have done all that.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c095531f6dbe71243a75b43101d7767a, type: 2}
    TextBody: Well I think we now know everything we need to know. We're about ready
      to solve this problem. Thanks everyone!
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8f3e30385ec7a1e40b2588b0e6f6bb35, type: 2}
